# Telling stories with Data - A Hands-on Introduction to Data Journalism

## 2 Getting Data
There are different types of data:
structured or unstructured, privat or public, clean or messy.

Structured data imposes its own structure. It is information that is organized according to a fixed schema so that it can be easily processed by computers and software programs. Essentially, structured data is organized and can be presented in tabular form, with clearly defined rows and columns. 

In contrast, unstructured data, such as audio or video files, is less formatted and cannot be easily organized into tables.
